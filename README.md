# NLP

## Useful Resource for NLP
* [Python Notebook 1](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Python%20Notebook%201.ipynb): Sample NLTK's PorterStemmer, FreqDist, WordNetLemmatizer, word_tokenizer, sent_tokenizer, ChartParser, pos_tag
* [Python Notebook 2](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Python%20Notebook%202.ipynb): WordNetLemmatizer, examine unique tokens, sort by most frequent, find longest word, spelling correction using ngrams, jaccard distance and levenshtein's distance
* [Python Notebook 3](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Python%20Notebook%203.ipynb): Building models using SKLearn countvect. Also ngrams, tdidf demo.
* [Python Notebook 4](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Python%20Notebook%204.ipynb): Semantic Text Similarity. Topic Modelling
* [Applied Text Mining Assignment 1](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Applied%20Text%20Mining%20Assignment%201.ipynb): Assignment 3 for Applied Text Mining Coursera Course. Date Extractor.
* [Applied Text Mining Assignment 2](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Applied%20Text%20Mining%20Assignment%202.ipynb): Assignment 2 for Applied Text Mining Coursera Course. NLTK. Word Tokenize, WordNetLemmatizer, FreqDist, Pos-tag. Spelling Recommender.
* [Applied Text Mining Assignment 3](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Applied%20Text%20Mining%20Assignment%203.ipynb): Assignment 3 for Applied Text Mining Coursera Course. Spam filtering exercise. Applying SVM, logistic, multinomial Naive Bayes, tfidf vectorizor, count vectorizer and some feature engineering. Good to quickly look through.
* [Applied Text Mining Assignment 4](https://github.com/nhanwei/NLP/blob/master/Applied%20Text%20Mining%20Assignment%204.ipynb): Semantic Text Similarity. Topic Modelling
